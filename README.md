This is my personal website â€“ something that describes my passion for web designing.

This portfolio is made to:
â€¢ Share a little bit about myself and my journey so far.
â€¢ Highlight my background in education.
â€¢ Show off the tech and design skills Iâ€™ve been learning.
â€¢ Display the projects Iâ€™ve worked on (even the small ones!).
â€¢ Let people reach out if they wanna talk, collab, or just say hi.

The website includes these main parts:
1.	Home â€“ A quick intro about myself.
2.	About â€“ A more detailed look at me, what I love â€“ basically what I am.
3.	Education â€“ The schools Iâ€™ve gone to and what Iâ€™m currently studying.
4.	Skills â€“ My soft and hard skills.
5.	Projects â€“ Some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, with little descriptions.
6.	Contact â€“ A simple way to message or connect with me online.
I used HTML for the structure and CSS for the styles and layout â€“ with the help of Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons.

Happy viewing! ðŸ˜Š
